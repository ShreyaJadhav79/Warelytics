# Warelytics — Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀  

Welcome to **Warelytics**, a complete SQL-based data warehousing and analytics project!  
This project brings together the entire data journey — from raw data storage to generating powerful business insights — all built using **Microsoft SQL Server** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  

Designed as a portfolio project, Warelytics showcases how real-world data can be structured, processed, and analyzed using modern data architecture and SQL-based analytics.

## 🏗️ Project Overview  

This project combines **data warehousing** and **data analytics** concepts into a single workflow:  

1. **Data Architecture** – Designed a modern data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).  
2. **ETL Pipelines** – Extracted, cleaned, and transformed data from ERP and CRM sources.  
3. **Data Modeling** – Built fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical reporting.  
4. **Data Analytics** – Performed exploratory and business analysis using SQL queries.  
5. **Reporting** – Developed customer and product performance insights using analytical SQL scripts.  

🎯 This project helped me learn how to organize raw data, transform it into structured insights, and analyze business performance effectively.

## 🧩 Key Objectives  

- Build a scalable **data warehouse** to store and organize data efficiently.  
- Design **ETL workflows** for cleaning and transforming raw datasets.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and insights.  
- Create **reports** that highlight key performance metrics for customers and products.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

1. **Bronze Layer** — Stores raw data from multiple sources (ERP & CRM).  
2. **Silver Layer** — Cleanses, standardizes, and prepares data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer** — Business-ready data modeled into fact and dimension tables for reporting.  
4. **Analytics Layer** — Contains SQL scripts for exploration, ranking, segmentation, and reporting.
